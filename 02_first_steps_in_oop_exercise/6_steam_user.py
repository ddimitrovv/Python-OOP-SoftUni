# Create a class called SteamUser.
# Upon initialization, it should receive a username (string) and games (list).
# It should also have an attribute called played_hours (0 by default).
# Add three methods to the class:
#   - play(game, hours)
#       o If the game is in the game list, increase the played_hours by the given hours
#           and return "{username} is playing {game}"
#       o Otherwise, return "{game} is not in library"
#   - buy_game(game)
#       o If the game is not in the game list, add it and return "{username} bought {game}"
#       o Otherwise, return "{game} is already in your library"
#   - status() - returns the following:
#       "{username} has {games_count} games. Total play time: {played_hours}"
# Submit only the class in the judge system.
